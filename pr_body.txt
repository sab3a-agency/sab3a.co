## Testing New Branch Protection Rules

This PR demonstrates the new workflow where:

### What's Required:
- Build must pass (automated check)
- Conversations resolved

### What's NOT Required:
- No approval needed
- No manual review required
- No admin bottleneck

---

## Test Instructions

1. Check that CI runs automatically
2. Wait for build to pass (~2 minutes)
3. Try to merge WITHOUT approval
4. Should work!

---

## Expected Behavior

### Before (Old Rules):
- Required 1 approval
- Had to wait for admin
- Admin bottleneck

### Now (New Rules):
- No approval needed
- Merge when build passes
- Team autonomy

---

## Benefits

- Faster - No waiting for approvals
- Safe - Build ensures quality
- Autonomous - Team can move fast
- Automated - Quality enforced by CI

---

Let's see if you can merge this without approval!
